## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- Moment JS library for date

### What I learned

Made first working version, but it was full of `if-else` statements. So, I
decided to make it more readable and clear. It was good practice, but still have
a lot of way to go.
